# Simplest-Instagram-Automation

Here are some Javascript lines of code that I wrote to automatize -Following & -Unfollowing wherever you go. 

The idea of this code is to automate tedious actions. After working on a similar project with Python I went through some Javascript videos on youtube and I realized how appropiate it was for these little tasks.

Very basic instructions to make sure everyone can use this:

0: LogIn to Instagram on Google Chrome.

1: Choose and copy the code for the action you are interested in.

2: Once in the home page inspect the element of the website and go to the console or simply press F12.

3: Paste the code in the console but do not run it yet.

4: Press Ctrl + Shit + M or Select the mobile displayment for the website. Refresh the page.

5: Now if you want to unfollow people go to your account, select your 'Following' list and run the code.

6: If you want to follow people we need a list of people. You can go the 'Likes' on a picture or 'Followers' of another account. Once you are there run the code.

Important! > Play around with the numbers but don't be greedy; Instagram doesn't support the use of automation actions.
